# Image-classification-with-TensorFlow-
Built a neural network model to solve a basic image classification problem, on MNIST dataset
Steps Involved:
1) Import Packages
2) Load Data
3) One Hot Encoding (labels)
4) Data Reshaping
5) Data Normalization (Mean and Standard Deviation)
6) Creating a model (structure, layers)
7) Compiling the model (optimizer, loss, metrics)
8) Model fitting
9) Evaluating the model (loss , accuracy)
10) Predictions
11) Plotting
